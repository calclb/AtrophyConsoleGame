# AtrophyConsoleGame
This is a command-line game I spent my sophomore year of high school making. It is incomplete—but it is my first independent attempt at a large project, and a step away from tutorial hell.

I admit what follows is in part a rant, and in part a story.

## Motivation

I began this project when I was somewhat dissatisfied by the things taught in AP Computer Science. It really only taught the Java langauge—but not with tools that I would today consider industry standard, let alone other languages. Here are just some things I would feel are absolutely critical for any successful developer project:
- Version control (Git as a VCS; GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket as remote repository hosts)
- Unit and integration testing
- Handling databases (e.g. MongoDB)
- Watching API endpoints (e.g. REST APIs)
- Continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), e.g. GitHub Actions and CircleCI, among others
- Debugging (runtime errors in particular; such as a `NullPointerException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, or `ConcurrentModificationException` in Java)
  - Yes, I typed these errors up by memory, if that says anything about how many hours of trouble they gave me.
- Experience with resolving and managing bug reports and GitHub issues (i.e. **collaborating with others**)

This is by no means exhaustive. Yet none of them seem to be taught in a subsidized public education for those interested. Of course, these aren't things that will ever be thoroughly learned in just a semester. This means students typically have two options: (1) drop tens of thousands on an undergraduate degree, or (2) learn everything themselves or (if you're lucky) with anyone else that happens to share the same interest as them.

Figured I might as well try both.

Choice two certainly feels more appealing, but there are important externalities that you will miss out on. I never went to a party in high school. I never went to a school event (outside of those required by marching band for freshman year). Together with COVID-19, I basically threw away my social life.

Other responsibilities or the lack of motivation still get in your way, though. At the time of writing, I can't apply unit testing and CI/CD in my private projects at all. Part of the reason for that is because my coding sessions function like a motivational rollercoaster: sometimes my interest falls through the floor for months; sometimes I'm still focused on a personal project late at night. On occasion, I would spend late nights trying to push out what I thought was a genius idea, or pulling my hair out because no matter what I do the same bug appears each time the program runs. And then somehow fix it in minutes the next morning.

None of that learning appears as an academic achievement. The only gratification you receive from this kind of undertaking is your pride and satisfaction in having the program compile and run the way you want it to. (Hopefully it runs the way you intended it.)

Ultimately, though, I leave this here as my sophomore cornerstone, and a reminder to myself (and others) that the good code only comes after the flawed code.
